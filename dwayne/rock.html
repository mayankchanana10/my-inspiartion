<h2>Starting Wrestling in WWE</h2>
<hr style="width:30%;margin-left:0px">
<p>Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring <br>names, although his real name was acknowledged by the announcers.[59] He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross.[45][60] He was given the nickname "The Blue Chipper" and his lineage was played to on TV, where he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler.[3] Maivia, a clean-cut face character, was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on Monday Night Raw as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[61] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, in an eight-man <br>elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[62] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on Monday Night Raw.[63][64][65] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your <br>House 13: Final Four. He had his first WrestleMania match at WrestleMania 13 where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship<br> defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[66] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of Raw is War.[67] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[68] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[69] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of "die, Rocky, die" and "Rocky sucks" being heard during his matches<br>
The Rock was then entered into the "Deadly Game" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at Survivor Series,<br> where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, Mankind, to win his first WWF Championship.[82][83] A "double turn" then occurred as the Rock turned heel again after allying with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation, after the McMahons betrayed Mankind.[82][84] On December 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, the Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.[84][85]

The Rock continued to feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, which was traded back and forth between them.<br> First, in the main event of the January 4, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, Mankind defeated the Rock after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.[86] Then at the Royal Rumble on January 24, the Rock regained the title in a brutal “I Quit” <br>match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says “I quit” on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious mean streak in the Rock's character, this match went horribly wrong as at the end of the match the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being a risky amount (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the 5th shot, Mankind was still at ringside instead of being two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot which knocked a bloodied Mankind out, a recording of <br>
<img src="rock7.jpg" height="800" width="500" style="float:left">
Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.[87][88] On January 31, during an episode of Sunday Night Heat, the Rock and Mankind participated in an Empty Arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of<br> chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a forklift truck to win the WWF title.[89] This match was referred to as "Halftime Heat" as it was televised during halftime of that year's Super Bowl.[90] The two faced off again, at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House, in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on the February 15 Raw Is War, when the Rock won his third WWF Championship in a Ladder Match after a debuting Big Show interfered on his behalf.[91][92] The Rock then lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV.[93]
<br>
The Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered<br> for him even though he was a heel. He then lost the title rematch against Stone Cold Steve Austin at Backlash: In Your House.[94] The next night on Raw is War he was fired from the Corporation after he was betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with Triple H, The<br> Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry. On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of SmackDown!, a term <br>derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at Over the Edge, which the Rock won,[95] and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at King of the Ring, which the Rock lost.[96] The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at Fully Loaded, after interference from "Mr. Ass" Billy Gunn.[97] The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the<br> Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as <br>weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs Al Snow in Houston)

<br>Shortly after SummerSlam, the Rock began teaming with former opponent Mankind and the two became known as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection.[99] They became WWF Tag Team Champions for the first time after defeating The Undertaker and Big Show for the titles on the August 30, 1999 episode of Raw is War.[100][101] The two performed a number of <br>critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called "This Is Your Life", which saw Mankind bring parody versions of people from the Rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the Rock insult them. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a Raw segment.[102] The two lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show on the September 9, 1999 episode of SmackDown! and won them back from them on the September 20, 1999 episode of Raw is War.[103][104] Rock and Mankind then lost the titles to The New Age Outlaws on the very next episode of SmackDown!.[105] Rock <br>and Mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the New Age Outlaws on the October 14, 1999 episode of SmackDown! before losing the titles to The Holly Cousins on the October 18, 1999 episode of Raw is War.[106][107]

At <br>royal Rumble, on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show. In an attempt at a "false finish", Big Show intended to throw the Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before <br>re-entering the ring as the winner.[108] However, the Rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt although those watching the event on television did not see that. This was played up in the storyline as Big Show provided additional video footage showing this fact, and claimed to be the rightful winner. The Rock's number one contendership for the WWF Championship was then put on the line against Big Show at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered.[109] The Rock then defeated Big Show, on the March 13 episode of Raw Is War, to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a Fata<br>l Four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley.[110][111] Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife Stephanie, Foley had Linda, the Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane.[111][112] The Rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by then-reigning champion Triple H after Vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair<hr><hr>
