<p>Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company.<br>

As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles,<br> battery products and solar energy products.

Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla product, <br>the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which began customer deliveries in early 2020.

Tesla also produces three energy storage products, the Powerwall home battery, the Powerpack commercial-scale battery, and<br> Megapack, which is designed for utility-scale installations. In 2016, Tesla became the world’s first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company with the acquisition of SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States, and in 2017 released Solar Roof – a beautiful and affordable energy generation product.

As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets. <br>In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first privately developed liquid fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, completed its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s crew-capable version of the Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and the company will fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time in 2020. Building on these achievements, SpaceX is developing Starship – a fully reusable transportation system that will carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond ­– and Starlink, which will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. By pioneering reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the long-term goal of making<br> humans a multi-planet species by creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.

Elon is also CEO of Neuralink, which is developing ultra-high bandwidth<br> brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to <br>computers.

He also launched The Boring Company, which combines fast, affordable tunneling<br> technology with an all-electric public transportation system in order to alleviate soul-crushing urban congestion and enable high-speed, long-distance travel. The Boring Company built a 1.15 mile R&D tunnel in Hawthorne, and is currently constructing Vegas Loop, a public transportation system at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Previously, <br>
Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with <br>Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was<br> bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, <br>and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading Internet <br>payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services.

<p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,  but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer  <br>Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).  His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,   
Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired<br> a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.  An awkward and introverted child, <br> Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs. He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and<br> Bryanston High School before <br>graduating from Pretoria Boys High School<br>
Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[24] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.  While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate a great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan.  He stayed there for a year, <br>working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.  In 1990, Musk <br>entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in<br> economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. 
<br>
In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games  In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of<br> Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[ Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response<br> to his inquiries.  He dropped out of Stanford after two days, <br>deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.

In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.It was announced on September 30, 2014, that eBay would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a move demanded in 2013 by activist hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn. The spin-off was completed on July 18, 2015.[45][46][47] Dan Schulman is the current president and CEO, with former eBay CEO John Donahoe serving as chairman.[44] On January 31, 2018, eBay announced that "After the existing eBay-PayPal agreement ends in 2020, PayPal will remain a payment option for shoppers on eBay, but it won't be prominently featured ahead of debit and credit card options as it is today. PayPal will cease to process card payments for eBay at that time." The company will "instead begin working with Amsterdam-based Adyen".[48]

On July 1, 2015, PayPal announced that it was acquiring digital money transfer company<BR> Xoom Corporation. PayPal spent $25 a share in cash to acquire the publicly traded Xoom, or about $1.09 billion. The deal was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The move strengthened PayPal’s international business, giving it access to Xoom’s 1.3 million active U.S. customers that sent about $7 billion in the 12 months ending on March 31, to people in 37 countries.[49][50]

On September 1, 2015, PayPal launched<BR> their peer-to-peer<BR> payment platform "PayPal.Me", a service that allows users to send a custom link to request funds via text, email, or other messaging platforms.[51] Custom links are set to be structured as PayPal.me/username/amount requested.[51] PayPal.Me was launched in 18 countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada, Russia, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland.[52] PayPal had 170 million users, as of September 2015, and the focus of PayPal.Me was to create a mobile-first user experience that enables faster payment sharing than PayPal's traditional tools.[51]

On May 17, 2018, PayPal agreed to purchase Swedish payment processor <BR>iZettle for $2.2 billion. This was PayPal's largest acquisition until late November 2019 and the company claims that it is the in-store expertise and digital marketing strength that will complement its own online and mobile payment services.[53]

On March 19, 2019, PayPal announced their partnership with Instagram as part <BR>of the company's new checkout feature, "Checkout on Instagram".[54][55]

In June 2019, PayPal reported that Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready would be leaving the company at the end of the year. In December 2019, Google announced that Ready would become the new commerce chief.[56]

On January 6, 2020, PayPal acquired Honey for over $4 billion. <BR>This is PayPal's largest acquisition to date, and its most recent.[57] It more recently signed a deal with NBCUniversal.[58]

In January 2021, PayPal became the<BR> first foreign operator with 100% control of a payment platform in China aiming to become in an advanced position as to the online payments.[59]

In an international survey conducted in March 2021 by Morning Consult, PayPal was found to<br> be the second most trusted brand globally.
PayPal Holdings,<br> Inc. is an American company operating an online payments system in the majority of countries that support online money transfers, and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as checks and money orders. The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites, and many other commercial users, for which it charges a fee.
PayPal's success in users and volumes was the product of a three-phase strategy described by former eBay CEO Meg Whitman: "First, PayPal focused on expanding its service among eBay users in the US. Second, we began expanding PayPal to eBay's international sites. And third, we started to build PayPal's business off eBay."[118]
<br>
Phase 1
In the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well. In fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.[118]
<br>
Phase 2
Until 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, many senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.[citation needed]
<br>
To solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.[citation needed]
<br>
Phase 3
After fine-tuning PayPal's business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal—Merchant Services—to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, <br>PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:[118]

Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from <br>2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)
Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a <br>maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)
Persuading credit card gateway providers<br>, including CyberSource and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.
Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as Dell,<br> Apple's iTunes, and Yahoo! Stores, which hosted thousands of online merchants
Reducing fees for online music purchases and other "micropayments"<br>
Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones
Global reach<br>
PayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.[119]
<br>
Different countries have different conditions: <br>Send only (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), PayPal Zero (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), SRW Send – Receive – Withdrawal (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and Local Currency (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).
Established in <BR>1998 as Confinity,[6] PayPal went public through an initial public offering in 2002. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay later that year, valued at $1.5 billion.[7][8] In 2015, eBay spun off PayPal to eBay's shareholders and PayPal became an independent company again.[5][9] The company was ranked 204th on the 2019 Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue

<h2>SpaceX</h2>
<hr style="width:12%;margin-left:0px">
<p>In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.<br>In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one<br> of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to <br>look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. <br> With $100 million of his early fortune,  Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.  As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer. 

After three failed launches, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first private liquid-fuel rocket to reach Earth orbit.[68] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement<br> In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.<br>Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.<br> Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform  In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.  In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities.  In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon project.<br> In 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed space-craft with the ISS<br>

SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low<br> Earth orbit satellites<br> in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[78] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation<br> occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.<br> The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated <br>by SpaceX to be about $10 billion
Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer, <br>space transportation services and communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization<br> of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Dragon cargo, crew spacecraft and Starlink communications satellites.

<br>SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first vertical take-off<br> and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private <br>company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 in 2020). SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.

<br>SpaceX is developing a satellite megaconstellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation in the world. SpaceX is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary spaceflight.<br> Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet.<br> Starship<br> will be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.<br>



In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[7][8][9] He announced that the project would be "the farthest that life's ever traveled" in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase NASA's budget.[7][8][9] Musk tried to purchase cheap rockets from Russia but returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price.[10][11]

On the flight home Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[11] By applying vertical integration,[10] using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,[11] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.[11]

In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion), and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.[12] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[13] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees, even going so far as convincing Larry Page to transfer a Google employee from San Francisco to Los Angeles so that the employee's spouse, a potential SpaceX hire, would take the job.[14]

Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[15]


The first successful Falcon 1 launch in September 2008
2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches
Main article: Falcon 1
SpaceX developed <br>its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with private funding.[16][17] The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately US$90 million[18] to US$100 million.[19]
<img src="elon19.jpeg" style="float:left;height:500px;width:600px">
In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial<br> space program through the end of the decade, a program which would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[20] In 2006, NASA announced that the company was one of two selected to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration<br> contracts to the ISS under the COTS program.[21]

The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under a <br>program that evaluates new US launch vehicles suitable for use by DARPA.[17][22][23] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures. These failures almost ended the company as Musk had<br> planned and financing to cover the costs of three launches; Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time as well;[24] Musk was reportedly "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because of the stress.[25]

However, things started to turn around when the first <br>successful launch was achieved shortly after with the fourth attempt on 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving <br>the company.[26] Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon after retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009; this allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[27] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at this time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with NASA.[28]

SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, <br>the Falcon 5.[29] SpaceX instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchase several <br>commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006<br> The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[30] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit<br> using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.<br>


The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, <br>the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[31] By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.<br>

In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew <br>Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a US$75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS  In August 2012, NASA awarded SpaceX a firm, fixed-price Space<br> Act Agreement (SAA) with the objective of producing a detailed design of the entire crew transportation system. This contract includes numerous key technical and<br> certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions following system certification.<br>

In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was <br>owned by Musk[35] and his 70 million shares were then estimated to be worth US$875 million on private markets,[36] valuing SpaceX at US$1.3 billion.[37] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.<br> After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to US$2.4 billion or US$20/share.[39][40] By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately $200 million, with Musk investing approximately $100 million and other investors having put in about $100 million.[41]

SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, <br>low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[42] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[

<h2>Tesla</h2>
<hr style="width:10%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="elon12.jpg" style="float:left;height:500px;width:600px">
<p>Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California. Tesla's current products include electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, as well as other related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had<br> the highest sales in the plug-in and battery electric passenger car segments, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of solar photovoltaic energy generation systems in the United States.<br> Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 GWh of battery storage supplied in 2020.

Founded in July 2003 by<br> Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk, who contributed most of the funding in the early days, has served as CEO since 2008.<br> According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of their first car model, the Roadster, in 2009.<br> This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the higher volume Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the world's all-time best-selling plug-in electric car, with more than 800,000 delivered through December 2020. Tesla's global<br> vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year. In 2020, the company surpassed the 1 million mark of electric cars produced.<br>

Tesla has been the subject of numerous lawsuits and controversies arising from statements <br>and acts of CEO Elon Musk, allegations of creative accounting, allegations of whistleblower retaliation, alleged worker rights violations, and allegedly unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products<br>

Founded as Tesla Motors, Tesla was incorporated on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively<br. Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor".<br>

Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] The three raised US$7.5 million in series A funding in February 2004 from various investors, including Elon Musk, who contributed the vast majority at $6.5 million. Following the investment, Musk joined the company<br> and became chairman of the board of directors.[<br>J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004<br> A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders<br>

Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. From the beginning, Musk consistently maintained that Tesla's long-term strategic goal was to create affordable mass market electric vehicles.[14] Tesla's goal was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then moving into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[15]

In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B $13 million investment round which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[citation needed][12] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006. This round included investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll. <br> A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[16] Prototypes of the Tesla's first car, the Roadster, were officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.[17]

In August 2007 Eberhard was asked to step down from his CEO position by the board of directors.<br> Eberhard then took the title of "President of Technology" before ultimately<br> leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.  In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev <br>Drori became CEO and President.  Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008. 

Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008. By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.  Later that year in June Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States <br>Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million interest.<br>
<img src="elon14.webp" style="float:right;height:500px;width:600px">
In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, for $42 million,[25] and opened<br> the facility in October 2010 where Model S would be produced.[26] The next month, on June 29, 2010, Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[27] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share, raising $226 million.[28]

In January 2012 Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[29] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[30] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[31] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[32]

Tesla announced the Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all <br>Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called "hardware version 1" or "HW1".[33]

In April 2015, Tesla entered the energy storage market unveiling its Powerwall home and Powerpack industrial battery packs.[34] The company received orders valued <br>at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[35]

Tesla launched its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Model X, in September 2015.<br>By this time, the company was selling over 10,000 vehicles per quarter
<br>
In recent years the company has been expanding their production capacity globally. Tesla opened its first Gigafactory outside the United States in Shanghai, China, in 2019. The Giga Shanghai was the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company, and was built in less than 6 months.[51] The following year Tesla also started construction on a new Gigafactory in Berlin, Germany, and another in Texas, United States. In March 2020, Tesla began deliveries of its fifth vehicle model, the Model Y crossover.[52]

On January 10, 2020, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $86 billion, breaking the record for greatest valuation of any <br>American automaker.[53] On June 10, 2020, Tesla's market capitalization surpassed those of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined.[54] The next month, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota's $202 billion to become the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization.[55] On August 31, 2020, Tesla had a 5-for-1 stock split following the increase in value.[56]

From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four profitable quarters in a row for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[57] Tesla was added to the index on December 21 of the same year.[58] It was the largest company ever added, and the sixth-largest company in the index at the time of inclusion.[58] As investors tried to buy more shares as a result of this inclusion, some analysts, such as J.P. Morgan's Ryan Brinkman, suggested investors exercise caution as Tesla was "dramatically" overvalued.[59] In 2020, the share price of Tesla increased 740%,[60] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion,[61] more than the next nine largest automakers combined and making it the 5th most valuable company in the US.[62][63]

In October 2020, Tesla told Electrek that they had dissolved their PR department (with the exception of a few PR managers representing Tesla's European and Asian markets), becoming <br>the first automaker to do so.[64]


Supercharger network
Main article: Tesla Supercharger

Tesla Model S charging at a Supercharger station in Newark, Delaware
In 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480-volt fast-charging Supercharger stations. As of November 2020, Tesla operates over 20,000 Superchargers in over 2,100 stations worldwide.[141] The Supercharger is a proprietary direct current (DC) technology that<br> provides up to 250 kW of power.[142] The navigation software in Tesla cars can recommend the fastest route for long-distance travel, incorporating possible charging delays.<br>
<br>
Almost all Tesla cars come standard with Supercharging hardware. Model S and X cars ordered before January 15, 2017 received free unlimited supercharging. Model S and X cars ordered between January 15, 2017 and August 3, 2019 got 400 kWh (1,400 MJ) of free Supercharging credits per year,<br> which provides a range of roughly 1,000 miles per year (1,600 km/a).<br> Between August 3, 2019[145] and May 26, 2020,[146] all Tesla Model S and X cars ordered came with free unlimited supercharging again. Being a less premium model, Model 3 cars do not come with free unlimited supercharging.[147]

Destination charging location network<br>

Tesla destination charger in North America
In 2014, Tesla launched the "Destination Charging Location" Network by providing<br> chargers to hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, resorts and other full service stations to provide on-site vehicle charging at twice the power of a typical home charging station.<br>

Destination chargers are installed free of charge by Tesla-certified contractors; the locations must<br> provide the electricity at no cost to their customers.[149] All installed chargers appear in the in-car navigation system.<br>

Software updates and upgrades
Tesla vehicles' software is regularly updated over-the-air when new software and firmware versions are released. This allows the cars to remain up to date and improve after purchase.[151] Tesla also offers the option to unlock features in the car through over-the-air software upgrades after purchase. Available upgrades include basic Autopilot, Full Self Driving,[152] acceleration boost (for Model 3 owners),[153] and rear-heated seats (for Model 3 owners).[154]

Connectivity
All Tesla cars come with "Standard Connectivity" which provides navigation<br> using a cellular connection, and video streaming, internet browsing, and music streaming (with a paid subscription) only over WiFi or Bluetooth.<br>"Premium Connectivity" adds cellular access to live traffic, satellite maps, and music streaming, as well as video streaming, browsing the internet and "caraoke" when parked.<br>

Vehicle servicing
Tesla service strategy is to service its vehicles through remote diagnosis<br> and repair,[157] mobile technicians,[158] and Tesla-owned service centers.

In 2016, Tesla recommended to have any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 <br>miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: "your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes," and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[159]

Insurance<br>
Tesla partnered with Liberty Mutual Insurance <br>Company to offer an insurance plan designed specifically for its electric cars. The plan was made available to US customers in October 2017.[160][161] In August 2019, this partnership was superseded by a partnership with State National Insurance designed specifically for its electric cars.[162][163] It was initially only available to Tesla owners in California.[162] In July 2020, Musk, relying on data obtained through their partnership with State National Insurance, announced that Tesla was creating its own major insurance company. The insurance will use individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing.[164]

On June 4, 2017, the American Automobile Association <br>raised insurance rates for Tesla owners following a report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The report concluded that the Model S crashes 46% more often and is 50% more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. Similarly, the Model X was concluded to crash 41% more often and to be 89% more expensive to repair than similar vehicles. As a result, AAA raised insurance rates on Tesla cars by 30%. Tesla said that the analysis is "severely flawed and not reflective of reality", however, Tesla failed to provide any contradictory numbers.[165] Shortly thereafter, Russ Rader, the spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, confirmed the AAA's analysis and that "Teslas get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair afterward".[166][167] The following year, an analysis of claim frequency and insurance cost data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted by financial research provider 24/7 Wall St. found that the Tesla Model S and Model X were the two most expensive vehicles to insure.<br>] Musk hopes that these insurance rates will greatly decrease once driver-assist and self-driving technology become commonplace





Tesla hit its goal of building a half-million cars in 2020.[65] The company ended the year with over $19 billion of cash,[66] compared to $6.3 billion at the end of 2019<p>

<h2>SolarCity</h2>
<hr style="width:15%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="elon15.jpg" style="height:500px;float:left">
<p>SolarCity Corporation was a publicly traded company headquartered in Fremont, California that sold and installed solar energy generation systems as well as other related products and services to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The company <br>was founded on July 4, 2006, by Peter and Lyndon Rive,<br> the cousins of Tesla, Inc. CEO Elon Musk. Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016, at a cost of approximately $2.6 billion and reorganized its solar business into Tesla Energy.<br>

SolarCity heavily focused on door-to-door sales of leased systems, where customers would pay no upfront costs, but agree to purchase the power generated by those panels from the company for 20 years. The business model became<br> the most popular in the US and made the company <br>the largest residential solar installer, but gave SolarCity over $1.5 billion in debt by the time of the acquisition in 2016 and was criticized by consumer advocates and government regulators.<br>

Prior to acquisition by Tesla, the two companies had a close relationship. SolarCity offered free charging to Tesla Roadster owners at its charging stations, SolarCity became one of the first installers of Tesla's Powerwall home energy storage batteries, and with Elon Musk serving as the chairman of SolarCity.<br>
SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based<br> on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who was the chairman and helped start the company.[3] By 2009, solar panels it had installed were capable of generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]

In 2011, the company launched their expansion to the East Coast with the<br> acquisition of the solar division of Clean Currents[6] and groSolar.[7] Following the acquisitions, SolarCity expanded operations on the East Coast and opened in Connecticut,[8] Pennsylvania,[9] South Carolina,[10] Florida,[11] Vermont,[12] and New Hampshire.[13]

In 2013, <br>SolarCity was the leading residential solar<br> installer in the U.S.[14] and Solar Power World magazine listed it as the number two overall solar installation company in the U.S.[15] In 2013, SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million.[16] By 2015, its installed panels were capable of generating 870 MW of solar power[17] and accounted for approximately 28% of non-utility solar installations in the U.S. that year.[4]

In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to<br> $200 million in solar bonds, and would launch a new online website to allow purchasing the bonds; this was the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[18] In March 2016, SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[19]
<img src="elon16.jpg" style="float:right">
In late 2015, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in Nevada,<br> following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[20] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90, and was scheduled to rise to $38.51 by January 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and were to continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[20] As a result, SolarCity eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who was the chairman and helped start the company.[3] By 2009, solar panels it had installed were capable of generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power<br>

Solar leasing
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners: leasing rooftop solar to customers who would pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers paid for 20 years for power generated by those panels.[41] SolarCity's solar lease allowed some homeowners to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[<br>

The "no-money-down solar" business model became the most popular in the U.S.[44] and increased installations, but it also added considerably to SolarCity's debt, accounting for about half of the company's over $3 billion debt in 2016.[45] The business model was also criticized by consumer advocates and government regulators.<br>

Commercial solar panels
In May 2008, SolarCity completed what was, at the time, <br>the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose, at the North Campus of eBay; in July 2008, SolarCity completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.<br> SolarCity introduced additional financing options for businesses in 2009<br> and built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[51][52] Intel,[53] and the U.S. military.[54] In 2013, the company established GivePower as a non-profit branch of its solar business, which is an independent enterprise.<br>

Installation technology
SolarCity used proprietary mounting hardware that "snaps together" on rooftops eliminating<br> the need for rails, and utilized skirts to hide the hardware and panel edges.[56][57][58] SolarCity acquired the mounting technology when it purchased Zep Solar in 2013. The "railless" <br>system allowed installers to install solar panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches. Traditionally, solar panel installation had required workers to first outfit roofs with mounting rails and then attach solar panels to those rails. Tesla Energy continues to use the technology for its solar panel installations.<br>

Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[59] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements<br>and expanded its energy efficiency services to the East Coast







SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity's<br> 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, <br>"the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to <br>us".[100]

Customer litigation<br>
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the<br> leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a "fair" credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014 and 2017, SolarCity signed long-term <br>lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted<br> on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits <br>where it is the defendant in legal proceedings based on "residential foreclosure action".[101]

In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 <br>installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial – being named in the foreclosure<br> proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many<br> are immediately resolved with the relevant bank."[101]

Customer cancellation investigation<br>
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating Sunrun and SolarCity <br>in May 2017, and were looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[102]

The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how<br> many customers they are losing". The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies' health".[102] According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[102]

Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by<br> sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn't proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic's lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn't realize they had actually signed contracts.[102]

FCC receiving radio interference complaints
SolarCity installed SolarEdge inverter systems with a type of DC-DC converter <br>called an optimizer. These systems cause radio interference as documented in April 2016 QST magazine a publication of the ARRL.[103]

Federal settlement for allegations of False Claims Act violations<br>
In September 2017, as part of a legal settlement with the federal <br>government, SolarCity agreed to pay a $29.5 million penalty regarding allegations that the company overstated the cost of facilities it developed and submitted claims for under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which would be a violation of the False Claims Act. SolarCity dropped its lawsuit, Sequoia Pacific Solar I, LLC v. United States—in which the company alleged the federal government owed it more money—as part of the settlement.[104]

<br>As part of the settlement, the company agreed to “release all pending and future claims against the U.S. for additional payments from the grant program". The move ended a five-year investigation.

<h2>Starlink</h2>
<hr style="width:13%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="elon20.webp" style="float:left;width:600px;height:500px">
<p>Starlink is a satellite internet constellation being constructed by SpaceXproviding satellite Internet access The constellation will consist of thousands of mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), which communicate with designated ground transceivers.<br> The SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington houses the Starlink<br> research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control teams. The cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in May 2018 to be at least US$10 billion.v
<br>
Product development began in 2015. Two prototype test-flight satellites were launched in February 2018. Additional test satellites and 60 operational satellites were deployed in May 2019.<br> SpaceX launches up to 60 satellites at a time, aiming to deploy 1,584[8] of the 260 kg (570 lb) spacecraft to provide near-global service by late 2021 or 2022.v SpaceX started a private beta service in the Northern United States in August 2020[10] and a public beta in October 2020,[11] service beginning at high latitudes between 44° and 52° Northv

On 15 October 2019, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) submitted filings to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) on SpaceX's behalf to arrange spectrum for 30,000 additional Starlink satellites to supplement the 12,000 Starlink satellites already approved by the FCC.[14]
<br>



Astronomers have raised concerns about the constellations’ effect on ground-based astronomy and how the satellites will add to an already jammed orbital environment.[15] In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness during operation<br> The satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. <br>Additionally, the satellites are designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data
The communication satellite network SpaceX envisions was publicly announced <br>in January 2015, with bandwidth to carry up to 50% of all backhaul communications traffic, and up to 10% of local Internet traffic, in high-density cities.<br>CEO Elon Musk said that there is significant unmet demand for low-cost global broadband capabilities. 

The opening of the SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond was announced by SpaceX in January 2015 with partners, to develop and build out the new communication network. At the time, the Seattle-area office planned to initially hire approximately 60 engineers, and potentially 1000 people by 2018.[21] The company operated in 2,800 m2 (30,000 sq ft) of leased space by late 2016, and by January 2017 had taken on a 2,800 m2 (30,000 sq ft) second facility, both in Redmond.[<br>] In August 2018, SpaceX consolidated all their Seattle-area operations with a move to a larger three-building facility at Redmond Ridge Corporate Center to <br>support satellite manufacturing in addition to R&D. 


In July 2016, SpaceX acquired a 740 m2 (8,000 sq ft)<br> creative space in Irvine, California (Orange County).[24] SpaceX job listings indicated the Irvine office would include signal processing, RFIC, and ASIC development for the satellite program.<br>

By January 2016, <br>the company had publicly disclosed plans to have two prototype satellites flying in 2016,[26] and to have the initial satellite constellation in orbit and operational by approximately 2020.[18]

By October 2016, SpaceX had developed the initial satellites that they<br> hoped to launch and test in 2017, but the satellite division was focusing on a significant business challenge of achieving a sufficiently low-cost design for the user equipment, aiming for something that ostensibly can be installed easily at end-user premises<br> for approximately US$200. Overall, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said then that the project remained in the "design phase as the company seeks to tackle issues related to user-terminal cost".<br> Deployment of the constellation was not then projected until "late in this decade or early in the next"<br>

In November 2016, SpaceX filed an application with the Federal Communications<br> Commission (FCC) for a "non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite system in the Fixed-Satellite Service using the Ku- and Ka- frequency bands".[27]

In March 2017, SpaceX filed plans with the FCC to field a second orbital shell of more than<br>"V-band satellites in non-geosynchronous orbits to provide communications services" in an electromagnetic spectrum that has not previously been heavily employed for commercial communications services. Called the<br> "Very-Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) constellation" it would comprise 7,518 satellites and would orbit at just 340 km (210 mi) altitude,<br>while the smaller, originally planned group of 4,425 satellites would operate in the Ka- and Ku-bands and orbit at 1,200 km (750 mi) altitude.<br>
<Img src="elon25.jpg" style="height:560px;width:600px;float:right">
SpaceX's plans were unusual in two ways:<br>

the company intended to utilize the little-used V-band of the communications spectrum
they intended to use a new orbital regime, the very-low Earth orbit regime<br> of ~340 km (210 mi) altitude, where atmospheric drag is quite high, which normally results in short orbital lifetimes
The March 2017 plan called for <br>SpaceX to launch test satellites of the initial Ka/Ku-bands type in both 2017 and 2018, and begin launching the operational constellation in 2019. Full build-out of the approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) constellation of around 4,440 satellites was not then expected to be completed until 2024.[31]

The first two test satellites built were not flown but were used in ground testing<br>. The planned launch of two revised test satellites was then moved to 2018.[32][33]

Some controversy arose in 2015–2017 with regulatory authorities on licensing of the communications spectrum for these large constellations of satellites. The traditional and historical regulatory rule for the licensing spectrum has been that satellite operators could "launch a single spacecraft to meet their in-service deadline [from the regulator], a policy is seen as allowing an operator to block the use of valuable radio spectrum for years without deploying its fleet".[34] By 2017, the FCC had set a six-year deadline to have an entire large constellation deployed to comply with licensing terms. The international regulator, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), proposed in mid-2017 a guideline that would be considerably less restrictive.[citation needed] In September 2017, both Boeing and SpaceX petitioned the United States FCC for a waiver of the six-year rule,[34] but they were denied. By 2019, the FCC had ruled that half of the constellation must be in orbit in six years, with the full system in orbit nine years from the date of the license.<br>

SpaceX trademarked the name Starlink for their satellite broadband network in 2017;[36] the name was inspired by the book The Fault in Our Stars.[37]

SpaceX filed documents in late 2017 with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify their space debris mitigation plan, under which the company was to:

"...implement an operations plan for the orderly de-orbit of satellites nearing the end of their useful lives (roughly five to seven years) at a rate far faster than is required under international standards. [Satellites] will de-orbit by propulsively moving to<br> a disposal orbit from which they will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within approximately one year after completion of their mission.
<br>
In March 2018, the FCC issued SpaceX approval, with some conditions. SpaceX would need to obtain a separate approval from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).[39][40] The FCC supported a NASA request to ask SpaceX to achieve an even higher level of de-orbiting reliability than the standard that NASA had previously used for itself: reliably de-orbiting 90% of the satellites after their missions are complete.<br>

In May 2018, SpaceX expected the total cost of development and buildout of the <br>constellation to approach US$10 billion.[6] In mid-2018, SpaceX reorganized the satellite development division in Redmond, and terminated several members of senior management.<br>

In November 2018, SpaceX received U.S. <br>regulatory approval to deploy 7,518 broadband satellites, in addition to the 4,425 approved earlier. SpaceX's initial 4,425 satellites had been requested in the 2016 regulatory filings to orbit at altitudes of 1,110 km (690 mi) to 1,325 km (823 mi), well above the International Space Station. The new approval was for the addition of a very-low Earth orbit non-geostationary satellite orbit constellation, consisting of 7,518 satellites operating at altitudes from 335 km (208 mi) to 346 km (215 mi), below the ISS.[42] Also in November 2018, SpaceX made new regulatory filings with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to request the ability to alter its previously granted license in order to operate approximately 1,600 of the 4,425<br> Ka-/Ku-band satellites approved for operation at 1,150 km (710 mi) in a "new lower shell of the constellation" at only 550 km (340 mi)[43] orbital altitude.[44][45] These satellites would effectively operate in a third orbital shell, a 550 km (340 mi) orbit, while the higher and lower orbits at approximately 1,200 km<br> (750 mi) and approximately 340 km (210 mi) would be used only later, once a considerably larger deployment of satellites becomes possible in the later<br>years of the deployment process. The FCC approved the request in April 2019, giving approval to place nearly 12,000 satellites in three orbital shells: initially approximately 1,600 in a 550 km (340 mi)<br> - altitude shell, and subsequently placing approximately 2,800 Ku- and Ka-band spectrum satellites at 1,150 km (710 mi) and approximately 7,500 V-band satellites at 340 km (210 mi).[35]
<img src="elon23.jpg" style="float:left;width:600px">
With plans by several providers to build commercial<br> space-Internet mega-constellations of thousands of satellites increasingly likely to become a reality, the U.S. military began to perform test studies in 2018 to evaluate how the networks might be used. In December 2018, the U.S. Air Force issued a US$28 million contract for specific test services on Starlink.[46]

In February 2019, a sister company of SpaceX, SpaceX Services Inc., filed a request with the FCC to receive a license for the operation of up to a million fixed satellite Earth stations that would communicate with its non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite Starlink system.<br>

SpaceX's plans in 2019 were for the initial 12,000 satellites to orbit in three orbital shells:

First shell: 1,440 in a 550 km (340 mi) altitude shell<br>
Second shell: 2,825 Ku-band and Ka-band spectrum satellites at 1,110 km (690 mi)

Third shell: 7,500 V-band satellites at 340 km (210 mi)<br>
In total, nearly 12,000 satellites were planned to be deployed, with (as of 2019) a possible later extension to 42,000 

By April 2019, SpaceX was transitioning their satellite efforts from research and development to manufacturing, with the planned first launch of a large group of satellites to orbit, and the clear need to achieve an average launch rate of "44 high-performance, low-cost spacecraft built and launched every month for the next 60 months"<br> to get the 2,200 satellites launched to support their FCC spectrum allocation license assignment<br> SpaceX said they will meet the deadline of having half the constellation "in orbit within six years of authorization... <br>and the full system in nine years" 

By the end of June 2019, SpaceX had communicated with all 60 satellites but lost <br>contact with three; the remaining 57 worked as intended. Forty-five satellites had reached their final orbital altitude of 550 km (340 mi), five were still raising their orbits, and another five were undergoing systems checks before they raise their orbits. <br>The remaining two satellites were intended to be quickly removed<br>from orbit and re-enter the atmosphere in order to test the satellite de-orbiting process; the three that lost contact were also expected to re-enter, but will do <br>so passively from atmospheric drag as SpaceX was no longer able to actively control them. 

In June 2019, SpaceX applied to the FCC for a<br> license to test up to 270 ground terminals – 70 nationwide across the United States and 200 in Washington (state) at SpaceX employee homes[51][52] – and aircraft-borne antenna operation from four distributed United States airfields; as well as five ground-to-ground test locations.<br>

By September 2019, SpaceX had<br>gone back to the FCC to apply for more changes to the orbital constellation. SpaceX asked to triple the number of orbital planes in the 550 km (340 mi) orbital shell, from 24 to 72, arguing that they could then place satellites into multiple planes from a single launch. SpaceX argued that this change could bring coverage to the southern United States in time for the 2020 hurricane season<br>The change was approved in December 2019, and will now see only 22 satellites in each plane rather than the 66 that had been a <br>part of the original design. The total number of satellites in the 550 km shell would remain the same, at around 1,600 

In October 2019, Elon Musk publicly tested the Starlink network by using an Internet<br> connection routed through the network to post a tweet to social media site

<h2>Hyperloop</h2>
<hr style="width:15%;margin-left:0px">
<p>The Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and freight transport. The term was invented to describe the modern open-source project.<br> Hyperloop is described as a sealed tube or system of tubes with low air pressure through which a pod may travel substantially free of air resistance or friction.<br>The Hyperloop could potentially convey people or objects at airline or hypersonic speeds while being energy efficient compared with existing high-speed rail systems  This, if implemented, may reduce travel times compared <br>to train and airplane travel[1] over distances of under approximately 1,500 kilometres (930 miles). 
<img src="elon26.jpg" style="float:right">
The Hyperloop concept has its roots in a concept invented by George Medhurst in 1799 and subsequently<br> developed under the names pneumatic railway, atmospheric railway or vactrain.[3] Elon Musk mentioned the Hyperloop in 2012, bringing it back to public attention<br> His initial concept incorporated reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven by linear induction motors and axial compressors.  The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and examining a route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay Area, roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor. The Hyperloop Genesis paper conceived of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the 350-mile (560 km) route at a speed of 760 mph (1,200 km/h), allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for this LA–SF suggested route were included in the white paper—US$6 billion for a passenger-only version, and US$7.5 billion for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers and vehicles.<br> However, transportation analysts expressed doubts that the system could be constructed on that budget, including some predictions that the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars over budget once construction, development, and operation costs are taken into consideration.<br>
<br>
The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX, and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them. To that end, a few companies have been formed, and several interdisciplinary student-led teams are working to advance the technology.<br> SpaceX built an approximately 1-kilometre-long (0.62 mi) subscale track for its pod design competition at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California  TUM Hyperloop set the world record of 463 km/h (288 mph) in July 2019 during the Hyperloop pod competition at SpaceX.[12][13] Virgin Hyperloop conducted the first human trial in November 2020 at its test site in Las Vegas.<br>




The vactrain concept was first proposed by Robert H. Goddard in 1904.<br> The concept was also depicted in the 1973 movie Genesis II where an elaborate "subshuttle" <br>subterranean rapid transit system was constructed to interlink cities and <br>continents.[citation needed]
<br>
Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the Hyperloop, in July 2012 at a PandoDaily event in Santa Monica, California. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the <br>following characteristics: immunity to weather, collision free, twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations.[16] The name Hyperloop was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at hypersonic speed.[17] In May 2013, Musk likened the Hyperloop to a "cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table".[18]
<br>
From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both Tesla and SpaceX worked on the conceptual modeling of Hyperloop.[19] An early system design was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blog<br>which describes one potential design, function, pathway, <br>and cost of a hyperloop system.<br> According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on air bearings through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of grade crossings. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient,<br> quiet, and autonomous than existing modes of mass transit. Musk has also invited feedback to "see if the people can find ways to improve it". The Hyperloop Alpha<br> was released as an open source design.[23] The word mark "HYPERLOOP", applicable to "high-speed transportation of goods in tubes" was issued to SpaceX on 4 April 2017.[24][25]

In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would build a 1-mile-long (1.6 km) test track to be located next to SpaceX's Hawthorne facility. The track would be used to test pod designs supplied by third parties in the competition<br>
<br>
By November 2015, with several commercial companies and dozens of student teams pursuing the development of Hyperloop technologies, the Wall Street Journal asserted that "The Hyperloop Movement", as some of its unaffiliated members refer to themselves, is officially bigger than the man who started it."<br>

The MIT Hyperloop team developed the first Hyperloop pod prototype, which they unveiled at the MIT Museum on 13 May 2016. Their design uses electrodynamic suspension for levitating and eddy current braking. 
<br>
On 29 January 2017, approximately one year after phase one of the Hyperloop pod competition,[30] the MIT Hyperloop pod demonstrated the first ever low-pressure Hyperloop run in the world.<br>Within this first competition the Delft University team from the Netherlands achieved the highest overall competition score, winning the prize for "best overall design".<br> The award for the "fastest pod" was won by the team WARR Hyperloop from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany.[34] The team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) placed third overall in the competition, judged by SpaceX engineers<br>

The second Hyperloop pod competition took place from 25–27 August 2017. The only judging criterion was top speed, provided it was followed by successful deceleration. WARR Hyperloop from the Technical University of Munich won the competition by reaching a top speed of 324 km/h (201 mph) and therefore breaking the previous record of 310 km/h (190 mph) for Hyperloop prototypes set by Hyperloop One on their own test track.<br>
<br>
A third Hyperloop pod competition took place in July 2018. The defending champions, the WARR Hyperloop team from the Technical University of Munich, beat their own record with a top speed of 457 km/h (284 mph) during their run.<br>

The fourth competition in August 2019 saw the team from the Technical University of Munich, now known as TUM Hyperloop (by NEXT Prototypes e.V.),[40] again winning the competition and beating their own record with a top speed of 463 km/h (288 mph).[33]

The first-ever passenger test of Hyperloop technology was successfully conducted by Virgin Hyperloop with two employees of the company in November 2020<br>

<h2>Open AI</h2>
<hr style="width:12%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="elon28.jpeg" style="float:left;width:600px;height:550px">
<p>OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory consisting of the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. The company, considered a competitor<br> to DeepMind, conducts research in the field of AI with the stated goal of promoting and developing friendly AI in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. The organization was founded in San Francisco in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others, who collectively pledged US$1 billion. Musk resigned from the board in February 2018 but remained a donor. In 2019, OpenAI LP received a US$1 billion investment from Microsoft.
<br>






In October 2015, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and other investors announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged over US$1 billion to the venture. The organization stated they would "freely collaborate" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[3][4]

On April 27, 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym", its platform for reinforcement learning research.[5]

On December 5, 2016, OpenAI released Universe, a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications.[6][7][8][9]

On February 21, 2018, Musk resigned his board seat, citing "a potential future conflict (of interest)" with Tesla AI development for self driving cars, but remained a donor.[10]

In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to for-profit. The company distributed equity to its employees[11] and partnered with Microsoft Corporation, who announced an investment package of US$1 billion into the company. OpenAI then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies, with Microsoft as its preferred partner.[12]

As of 2020, OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco's Mission District, and shares the former Pioneer Trunk Factory building with Neuralink, another company co-founded by Musk.[13][2]

In June 2020, OpenAI announced GPT-3, a language model trained on trillions of words from the Internet. It also announced that an associated API, named simply "the API", would form the heart of its first commercial product. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering of questions, but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text.[14]

Participants
CEO:[15] Sam Altman, former president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator
Ilya Sutskever, Research director, a former Google expert on machine learning[16]
CTO:[17] Greg Brockman, former CTO, 3rd employee of Stripe[16]
Other backers of the project include:[16]

Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder[18]
Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder[18]
Jessica Livingston, a founding partner of Y Combinator
Companies:

Infosys, one of the Indian IT firms[19]
Microsoft's cloud services division[20]
The group started in early January 2016 with nine researchers. According to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the "founding fathers" of the deep learning movement, and drew up a list of the "<br>best researchers in the field". Microsoft's Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect. While OpenAI pays corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, it doesn't currently pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google. Nevertheless, Sutskever stated that he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI <br>"partly of because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission."<br> Brockman stated that "the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving <br>humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way." OpenAI researcher Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down "borderline crazy" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.<br>

Motives
Some scientists, such as Stephen Hawking and Stuart Russell, have articulated concerns that if advanced AI someday gains the ability to re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable <br>"intelligence explosion" could lead to human extinction. Musk characterizes AI as humanity's "biggest existential threat."[22] OpenAI's founders structured it as a non-profit so that they could focus its research on creating a positive long-term human impac<br>

Musk and Altman have stated they are motivated in part by concerns about the existential risk from artificial general intelligence.[23][21] OpenAI states that "it's hard to fathom how much human-level<br> AI could benefit society," and that it is equally difficult to comprehend "how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly".[4] Research on safety cannot safely be postponed: "because of AI's surprising history, it's hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach.<br> OpenAI states that AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible..."<br>and which sentiment has been expressed elsewhere in reference to a potentially enormous class of AI-enabled products: "Are we really willing <br>to let our society be infiltrated by autonomous software and hardware agents whose details of operation are known only to a select few? Of course not."[25] Co-chair Sam Altman expects the decades-long project to surpass human intelligence.[26]

Vishal Sikka, former CEO of Infosys, stated that an "openness" where the endeavor would "produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity" was a fundamental requirement for his support<br> and that OpenAI "aligns very nicely with our long-held values" and their "endeavor to do purposeful work".[27] Cade Metz of Wired suggests that corporations such as Amazon may be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook that own enormous supplies of proprietary data. Altman states that Y Combinator companies will share their data with OpenAI.<br>

In 2019, OpenAI became a for profit company called OpenAI LP to secure additional funding while staying controlled by a non-profit called OpenAI Inc in a structure that OpenAI calls "capped-profit"  having previously <br>




<img src="elon29.jpg" style="float:right;width:600px;height:500px">


Strategy
Musk posed the question: "what is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure<br> with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity." Musk acknowledged that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; nonetheless, the best defense is "to empower as many people as possible to<br> have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."<br>

Musk and Altman's counter-intuitive strategy of trying to reduce the risk that AI will cause overall harm, by giving AI to everyone, is controversial among those who are concerned with existential risk from artificial intelligence. <br>Philosopher Nick Bostrom is skeptical of Musk's approach: "If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone."<br> During a 2016 conversation about the technological singularity, Altman said that "we don't plan to release all of our source code"<br> and mentioned a plan to "allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board". Greg Brockman stated that "Our goal right now... is to do the best thing there is to do. It's a little vague.<br>

Conversely, OpenAI's initial decision to withhold GPT-2 due to a wish to "err on the side of caution" in the presence of <br>potential misuse, has been criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated "I don't think [OpenAI] spent enough time proving [GPT-2] was actually dangerous." Other critics argued that open publication is necessary to replicate the research and to be able<br> to come up with countermeasures.[32]

In the 2017 tax year, OpenAI spent US$7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone<br> In comparison, DeepMind's total expenses in 2017 were much larger, measuring US$442 million. In Summer 2018, simply training OpenAI's Dota 2 bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks. According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model adopted in<br> March 2019 allows OpenAI LP to legally attract investment from venture funds, and in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company, the goal being that they can say "I'm going to Open AI, but in the long term it's not going to be disadvantageous to us as a family."[34] Many top researchers work for Google Brain, DeepMind, or Facebook, Inc., which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.[35] In June 2019, OpenAI LP raised a billion dollars from Microsoft, a sum which OpenAI plans to have spent "within five years, and possibly much faster".[36] Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need "more capital than any non-profit has ever raised" to achieve AGI.<br>

The transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by Oren Etzioni of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI, who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult<br>, but stated "I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can't compete" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. "If bigger and better funded was always better, then<br> IBM would still be number one." Following the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI LP <br>is no longer legally required. The nonprofit, OpenAI Inc., is the sole controlling shareholder of OpenAI LP. OpenAI LP, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal fiduciary responsibility to OpenAI's Inc.'s nonprofit charter. A majority of OpenAI Inc.'s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI LP.[34] In addition, minority members with a stake in OpenAI LP are barred from certain votes due to conflict of interest.[35] Some researchers have argued that OpenAI LP's switch to for-profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI's claims to be "democratizing" AI<br> A journalist in Vice News wrote that "generally, we've never been able to rely on venture capitalists to better humanity

<h2>The Boring Company</h2>
<hr style="width:28%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="elon30.jpg" style="float:right;width:600px;height:500px">
<p>The Boring Company   is an American infrastructure and tunnel construction<br> services company founded by Elon Musk. Its current and proposed projects are designed for intra-city ("loop") transit systems, although the company has stated that current tunnels are being built so they could support eventual transition to Hyperloop-based<br> transportation on longer inter-city routes 

TBC has completed two tunnels in Las Vegas for loop travel. It has also <br>completed one tunnel for testing Hyperloop and loop travel in Los Angeles County. Other tunnels are in various stages of discussion and planning.
<br>
Musk cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and what he sees as limitations with the current two-dimensional transportation network as his early inspiration for the project.[  The Boring Company was initially formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX, becoming a separate and fully independent company in 2018. As of December 2018, 90% of the equity was owned by Musk,[7] with 6% held by SpaceX in return for the use of SpaceX resources during the initial startup of the company.[8] Outside investments during 2019 have changed the equity split.<br>





Elon Musk announced the existence of The Boring Company in December 2016<br> By February 2017, the company had begun digging a 30-foot-wide (9 m), 50-foot-long (15 m), and 15-foot-deep (4.6 m) testing trench on the premises of SpaceX's offices in Hawthorne, since construction on its site would not require any permits.[3][10] When told by employees on a Friday afternoon that it would take at least two weeks to move staff cars in the parking lot and start digging the first hole with TBC tunneling machine, Musk said, "Let's get started today and see what's the <br>biggest hole we can dig between now and Sunday afternoon, running 24 hours a day." Later that day, the cars were gone and there was a hole in the ground.[11] The Boring Company was initially formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX[12] before becoming an independent company in 2018.[13]

In an interview during a TED conference in April 2017, Musk estimated that The Boring Company project had taken 2–3% of his time, making this venture a personal hobby.<br>

In March 2017, Musk announced that sometime in April the company would start using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) to begin digging a usable tunnel at SpaceX.[15] At the end of April 2017, a<br> TBM was seen at SpaceX with The Boring Company's name on the side.<br> The name of the TBM was revealed as Godot in May 2017, named after the Beckett play Waiting for Godot. Future TBMs will also be named after poems and plays ] Musk said the first route created would run from LAX to Culver City, then to Santa Monica, and end in Westwood. Musk claimed<br> the tunnel trip will take five minutes, compared to above-ground driving which takes 45 minutes in normal traffic (from LAX to Westwood).[18] These trips were planned to be implemented by placing a car on an electric sled and traveling at 120 miles per hour (200 km/h) through tunnels. By November 2017, the company had filed a permitting application with Los Angeles government regulators to build a tunnel from Hawthorne along Interstate 405 to Westwood.[19] The project never advanced.<br>

At the same time as the Los Angeles tunnel system was announced, a different project involving a Hyperloop (a sealed tube) running underground from New York City to Washington, D.C, was announced.<br>Musk claimed it would take 29 minutes to travel from one city center to the other.<br> Other Hyperloop projects include one from San Francisco to Los Angeles and another inside Texas, which were being considered for a later phase. <br>

In July 2017, Musk uploaded a video depicting a successful test of a prototype car elevator.<br> In October, Musk revealed the second TBM is named Line-storm, named after<br> the Robert Frost poem “A Line-Storm Song”.[24] March 2018, Elon Musk announced that the company would readjust its plan to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars;[25] cars would only be considered for transport after all other "personalized mass transit needs" were met.

In early 2018, The Boring Company was spun out from SpaceX and into a separate corporate entity. Somewhat less than 10% of equity was given to early employees, and over 90% to Elon Musk. Subsequent concerns by SpaceX shareholders resulted in a December 2018 reallocation of 6% of The Boring Company's equity to SpaceX.[13] TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line in December 2018 when they opened to the public their first 1-mile-long (1.6 km) test tunnel in Hawthorne, California.[27] In July 2019, The Boring<br> Company authorized the first external investment, selling US$120 million in stock to a number of venture capital firms,[28] after raising $113 million in non-outside capital during 2018.[29]
<br>
By November 2019, Steve Davis had become the president of The Boring Company after leading company efforts for Musk since 2016. Davis was one of the earliest<br> hires at SpaceX (in 2003) and has twin master's degrees in particle physics and aerospace engineering.<br> In November 2020, The Boring Company announced hiring for a number of positions in Austin, Texas, and by December 2020 had leased two buildings in a 14-acre (5.7 ha) industrial complex northeast of Austin, approximately 16 miles (26 km) north of where Tesla is building its Texas Gigafactor<br>





The Boring Company began constructing a 1.14-mile (1.83 km) high-speed tunnel in 2017 on a route in Hawthorne, California, adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility.[39] In June 2018, Musk said that the tunnel boring was complete and the tunnel final work was nearly done, would be open in a few months, and that people could try it for free, pending regulatory approval, when it first opened.[40][41] In November 2018, the company announced the entry fee of the tunnel would be $1 after free entry on day one.[citation needed] The project was opened on December 18, 2018 and this event showcased a Tesla Model X used in the tunnel.[42]

In September 2018, public information was released by the City of Hawthorne that a test spur and elevator has been proposed near the intersection of 120th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard. The elevator spur would enable engineering tests. Those tests would consist of: an automotive vehicle driven onto a "skate" above ground, the engine turned off, the vehicle (with passengers inside) lowered into the tunnel spur, moving the vehicle (possibly on the skate) through the tunnel, and then raising the vehicle on a skate to the surface at the other end of the test track, near the SpaceX facility.[12] By June 2019, the company paved the tunnel roadway with asphalt, smoothed the surface, added guide-way for autonomous vehicle operation, and were testing car runs (without a skate) through the mile-long tunnel at speeds of 90 mph (140 km/h) for autonomous control and up to 116 mph (187 km/h) with human control.[43]

Las Vegas
Convention center
In March 2019, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) recommended The Boring<br> Company for a system to shuttle visitors in a loop underneath the sprawling Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), to be completed by 2021, with the potential for future expansion<br>along the Las Vegas Strip and to Allegiant Stadium and McCarran International Airport.[44] In May 2019, the company won a $48.7 million project to do so<br> In September, on-site preparations for the tunnel project were reported, and construction started in October<br>

Maximum boring speeds were expected to reach 100 feet (30 m) per day.[48] Boring of the first tunnel, 4<br>,475 feet (1,364 m) long, began on November 15 and completed 91 days later on February 14, 2020, for an average speed of 49 feet (15 m) per day.<br>For comparison, the Second Avenue tunnel in New York City, which was completed in 2017, averaged between 40 and 50 feet per day.[51] In May 2020, the boring of the second tunnel was completed,<br>for a total of 1.7 miles (2.7 km) of tunnels. 

The tunnel was unveiled in mid-April 2021 with regular Tesla Model 3 and Model X cars used for shuttling,<br> running at about 35 miles per hour (56 km/h).[54] The service was described as "embarrassing"[55] and "lame",[56] due to comparisons with earlier promises of <br>"electric autonomous vehicles with alignment wheels". 
<br>
Testing with a large number of volunteers in late May 2021 showed the system could transport 4,400 passengers per hour[58] The system started transporting attendees of a convention center exhibition on June 8, 2021.[59] Instead of a 25 minute walk, the ride is 2 minutes

<p>Neuralink Corporation is a neurotechnology company developing implantable brain–machine interfaces <br>(BMIs) and founded by Elon Musk and others. The company's headquarters is in San Francisco.[6] The company was launched in 2016 and was first publicly reported in March 2017.[1][2]
<br>
Since its founding, the company has hired several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities<br> By July 2019, it had received $158 million in funding (of which $100 million was from Musk) and was employing a staff of 90 employees.[8] At that time, Neuralink announced that it was working on a "sewing machine-like" device capable of implanting very thin (4 to 6 μm in width[9]) threads into the brain, and demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1,500 electrodes. They had anticipated starting experiments with humans in 2020;[8] but have since moved that projection to 2021.[10]
<br>
Several neuroscientists and publications, including the MIT Technology Review, have criticized some claims made by Musk in relation to the technology<br>






Neuralink was founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, Max Hodak, Ben Rapoport, Dongjin Seo, Paul Merolla, Philip Sabes, <br>Tim Gardner, Tim Hanson and Vanessa Tolosa, a group of experts<br> in areas such as neuroscience, biochemistry and robotics,<br> The trademark "Neuralink" was purchased from its previous owners in January 2017.[13]
<br>
In April 2017, Neuralink announced that it was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism.[14][6][15] Musk had said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science fiction concept of "neural lace" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by Iain M. Banks. 

Musk defined the neural <br>lace as a "digital layer above the cortex" that would not necessarily imply extensive surgical insertion but ideally an implant through a vein or artery.[14][6][15]Musk explained that the long-term goal is to achieve "symbiosis with artificial intelligence",[18] which he perceives as an existential threat to humanity if it goes unchecked.[18][19]

As of 2020, Neuralink is headquartered in San Francisco's Mission District, sharing the Pioneer building with OpenAI, another company co-founded by Musk.[20][4] Jared Birchall, the head of Musk's family office, was listed as CEO, CFO and president of Neuralink in 2018.<br> As of September 2018, Musk was the majority owner of Neuralink but did not hold an executive position.[22]

By August 2020, only three of the eight founding scientists remained at the company, according to an article by Stat News which reported that Neuralink had seen "years of internal conflict in which rushed timelines [14][6][15]have clashed with the slow and incremental pace of science."<br>
<br>
In April 2021, Neuralink demonstrated a monkey playing the game "Pong" using the Neuralink implant.[24] While similar technology has existed since 2002, when a research group first demonstrated a monkey moving a computer cursor with neural signals, scientists acknowledged<br> the engineering progress in making the implant wireless and increasing the number of implanted electrodes.<br>

In May 2021, co-founder and <br>president Max Hodak announced that he no longer works with the company.[28]

Technology
In 2018, Gizmodo reported<br> that Neuralink "remained highly secretive about its work", although public records showed that it had sought to open an animal testing facility in San Francisco; it subsequently started to carry out research at the University of California, Davis<br>n 2019, during a live presentation at the California Academy of Sciences, the Neuralink team revealed to the public the technology of the first prototype they had been working on. It <br>is a system that involves ultra-thin probes that will be inserted into the brain, a neurosurgical robot that will perform the operations and a high-density <br>electronic system capable of processing information from neurons. It is based on technology developed at UCSF and UC Berkeley. 

Probes
The probes, composed mostly <br>of polyimide, a biocompatible material, with a thin gold or platinum conductor, are inserted into the brain through an automated process performed by a surgical robot. Each probe consists of an area of wires that contains electrodes capable <br>of locating electrical signals in the brain, and a sensory area where the wire interacts with an electronic system that allows amplification and acquisition of the brain signal. Each probe contains 48 or 96 wires, each of which contains 32 independent electrodes<br>, making a system of up to 3072 electrodes per formation 

Robot
Neuralink says they have developed a robot capable of rapidly inserting many flexible probes into the brain, which may avoid the problems of tissue damage and longevity associated with larger and more rigid probes.[31][32][33] This robot has an insertion head with a 40 μm diameter needle made of tungsten-rhenium designed to attach to the insertion loops, made to transport and insert individual probes, and to penetrate the meninges and tissue cerebral. The robot is capable of inserting up to six wires (192 electrodes) per minute.[31]

Electronics
<br>
Elon Musk discussing the Neuralink
Neuralink has developed an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to create a 1,536-channel recording system. This system consists of 256 amplifiers capable of being individually programmed ("analog pixels"), analog-to-digital converters within the chip ("ADCs") and a peripheral circuit control to serialize the digitized information obtained.[31] It aims to convert information obtained from neurons into an understandable binary code in order to achieve greater understanding of brain function and the ability to stimulate these neurons back. Currently, electrodes are still too big to record the firing of individual neurons, so they can record only the firing of a group of neurons; Neuralink representatives believe this issue might get mitigated algorithmically, but it's computationally expensive and does not produce exact results.[34]
<br>
In July 2020, according to Musk, Neuralink obtained a FDA breakthrough device designation which allows limited human testing under the FDA guidelines for medical devices.[35][36]
<br>
Reception
Several neurology scientists have<br> commented on the intention of Musk and members of Neuralink to build a brain-computer interface.[37] The response from the scientific community has been mixed.

At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk<br> described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" which could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities.[38] Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims.[11][12][39] For example, MIT Technology Review described them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[11]

Mary Lou Jepsen, founder of Openwater, a company that also works in the area of brain-computer interfaces, with the goal of creating a telepathy system, has expressed concern about the rejection reactions that probes can cause.[citation needed]
<br>
Thomas Oxley, MD, PhD, CEO of Synchron, an Australian company that is also developing a system to insert brain probes via blood-vessel-borne catheters that avoid any direct penetration of brain tissue, and therefore do not cause trauma, says no efficacy results from Neuralink are expected soon,[when?] as the technology is not advanced enough to achieve this. However, he believes that because Musk is willing to invest large sums of money in his company, it will be "exciting to see what he will develop."[citation needed]

Neuralink tests their devices by surgically implanting them in the brains of live monkeys, pigs and other animals<br>These methods have been criticized by groups such as PETA
