<p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: <br>; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballons d'Or[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records for a European player. He has won 32 major trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most international goals (109, tied with Ali Daei), the most goals (134) and assists (42) in the Champions League, and the most goals in the European Championship (14). He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances and has scored over 780 official senior career goals for club and country.

Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, <br>before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he helped United win three successive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009, Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). During his 9 seasons with Real Madrid, he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, and four Champions League titles, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer (451 times in 438 competitive appearances for Madrid, averaging over a goal a game).[9] After joining Madrid, Ronaldo finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi – his perceived career rival – before winning back-to-back Ballons d'Or from 2013–2014 and again from 2016–2017. After winning a third consecutive Champions League title in 2018, Ronaldo<br> became the first player to win the trophy five times. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million)<br>, the highest fee ever paid by an Italian club and the highest ever paid for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana and a Coppa Italia in his first three seasons with the club.

Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18, and has since earned over 170 caps, including appearing and scoring in eleven major tournaments, becoming Portugal's most capped player and his country's all-time top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 where he helped Portugal reach the final and assumed full captaincy of the national team<br><br>in July 2008. In 2015 Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year he led Portugal to their first triumph in a major tournament by winning Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament.
<br>
One of the most marketable and famous athletes in the world, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer, as well as only the third sportsman, to earn $1 billion in their career.</p>

<h2>Birth Life</h2>
<hr style="width:15%;margin-left:0px">
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo António, Funchal.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia"<br> His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings 
<img src="ron2.jpg" style="float:left">
As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,<br> where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.<br> He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting youth football academy  By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.  However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing footbal Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate  He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.He never graduated high school. Football came first. Some jokingly say that Cristiano majored in soccer with a minor in football. In an interview, his godfather recalled multiple times where the boy would sneak from his room to avoid school work and family dinners

<h1>Sporting Career</h1>
<hr style="width:40%;margin-left:0px">
<h2>Sports Club</h2>
<hr style="width:20%;margin-left:560px">
<p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October 2002, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier <br>and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer. 
<br>
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, however, was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had just planned to sign Ronaldo and then loan him back to Sporting for a year.<br>Having been impressed by him, however, the Manchester United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.  A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.


2003–2007: Development and breakthrough
<img src="ron3.jpg" style="float:right">
"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."
<br>—Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[29]
Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.<br> His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.  Although he requested the number 28,<br> his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.  Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[34]


Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea in the 2005–06 Premier League season
Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a substitute.[35] His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.  Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November<br> Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received his first red card.[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy.[39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.  The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat a man,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world class player.<br>

"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that<br> with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."
—Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.<br>
At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[43][44] He played the full 120 minutes of the FA Cup final against Arsenal which ended in a goalless draw, <br>and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shoot-out.[45] Ronaldo scored Manchester United's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[46] Midway through the season, in November, he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final victory over Wigan Athletic<br>

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a "one-fingered gesture" towards Benfica fans,[49] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole <br> Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.  Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[52] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club <br>over the incident.  United, however, denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[54]
<br>
Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,<br> it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a victory that put United on top of the league), Wigan Athletic and Reading<br> Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours

<h2>Collective and Individual Success</h2>
<hr style="width:40%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="ron4.jpg" style="float:left">
At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition<br>finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.  He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,  but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[64] He also helped United reach the FA Cup final, but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat. Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007 (his 50th goal for the club), as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years.<br>As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' <br>Association's Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.<br>His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week (£31 million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with United.[70] At the end of 2007, Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or<br> and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award<br>

Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win<br> against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table.<br> A month later, on 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton, and scored both goals of the match.<br> His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.<br> His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[  as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.<br> He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season ]

In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon,<br> which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate,  and, while playing as a striker, scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate victory over Roma.[81] United advanced to the final against Chelsea in Moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty being saved in the shoot-out,[82] Manchester United emerged victorious. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[ 
<br>
Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his<br> time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.<br>As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action<br>FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery"  Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,<br> he remained at United for another year

<br>Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks  Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,  which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time<br>At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,<br> assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.  He subsequently became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968,[<br>] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year. 
<br>
His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;  he later called it the best goal he had ever scored<br> United advanced to the final in Rome,[ ] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona<br> Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a Football League Cup.  He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford</p>
<hr><hr>
<h2>World Record</h2>
<hr style="width:20%;margin-left:0px">

Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).[ ] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.  At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.<br> Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,  which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[ 

Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, <br>against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.<br>He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player to do so.<br>His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[  His strong start to the season,<br> however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.<br> A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería  Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[117][118] His first season <img src="ron5.jpg" style="float:right">
at Real Madrid ended trophyless.<br>

Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010–11 season.  His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[121] His haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches <br>(three in La Liga, one in the Champions League, and two for Portugal) totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal, and Málaga.<br> Despite his performance, he did not make the podium for the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or at the end of 2010. 
<br>
During a historical series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all <br>competitions in a single season. Although he failed to find the net during Madrid's eventual elimination in the Champions League semi-finals, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final, winning his first trophy in Spain.  His two goals in the last <br>match of the season, against Almería, made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals  In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo consequently won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in two different leagues<br>


Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.<br>
During the following campaign, the 2011–12 season, Ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions.<br>He regained a place on the FIFA Ballon d'Or podium, as runner-up to Messi, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna, and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point<br>]

Ronaldo<br> found greater team success in the league, as he helped Real Madrid win their first La Liga title in four years, with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante, further increasing Madrid's lead over Barcelona<br>he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás<br> Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total<br> to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.<br> His final league goal of the campaign, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi and earned him the distinction of being the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season in La Liga.
<br>
Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese, Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.<br> Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a "professional issue" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,<br> his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo La Coruña, he<br> scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 victory over Ajax.<br>] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou  His performances in<br> 2012 again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, finishing runner-up to four-time winner Messi</p>

<img src="ron6.png" style="float:left">
<p>Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring a brace to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish<br> player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.<br> Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe<br>He scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.<br>He helped Madrid reach the Copa del Rey final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[148] a Real Madrid record.[139] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético Madrid, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[149] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu<br> he scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory at Old Trafford, his first return to his former home ground<br> He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.  After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, but failed to increase his side's 2–0 victory in the second leg, as they were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year. 
<br>
Ronaldo scored a record 17 UEFA Champions League goals during the 2013–14 La Décima season.
At the start of the 2013–14 season, <br>Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.  He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee<br> of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior. Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed "BBC", an acronym of Bale, Benzema, and Cristiano, and a play off the name of the public service broadcaster.[156] By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden<br> He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[160] He received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[161]

Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, <br>as he helped Real Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Borussia Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before  After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Aren<br> he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final victory over Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams<br>His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: "In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks."[165] As the Champions League top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,  he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe<br>

In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón,[168] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.<br> His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy<br> Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.<br>Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[172] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[173] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.<br>
During the next campaign, the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals in all competitions, starting with both goals in Real Madrid's 2–0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.<br> He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with a record 15 goals in the first eight rounds of La Liga.<br>His record 23rd hat-trick in La Liga, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 <br>goals in the Spanish league, as he reached the milestone in only his 178th game. ] After lifting the FIFA Club World Cup with Madrid in Morocco, and becoming the joint-top assist provider of the competition alongside Toni Kroos,[178] Ronaldo received a second successive FIFA Ballon d'Or,[179] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten as a three-time Ballon d'Or winner.
<br>

<h2>Comparison To Leonel Messi</h2>
<hr style="width:35%;margin-left:0px">
<img src="ron13.jpg" style="float:right"><p>Both players have scored in at least two UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.<br>It has been compared to sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis,<br> and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[432][433] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two,[434] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players,<br> as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.<br>


"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."
—Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi.<br>
In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[439] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own<br> personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."[440] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants<br> us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano."[441] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football<br>, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "We have <br>to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."  Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced e<br>ach other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game,<br> El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[442]
<br>
In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded – and promptly received<br> – a full apology, and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla, after Blatter<br> had described him as a "commander" on the pitch.[443] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: "Of course, <br>we have a good relationship. We haven't had dinner together yet, but I hope in the future. I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good <br>to be part of the history of football.</p>
